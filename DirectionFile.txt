Never Play Pac Man Before?
No Worries! Here's some simple directions:

1. Pac Man is the '@' symbol, you will move him around the board by using the
arrow keys.

2. The purpose is to collect all of dots on the screen, each dot it worth 100
points.

3. When navigating throughout to board you cannot walk through the walls
(walls are the '#' symbol).

4. There are also random holes throughout the board, if you land in a hole
you will die and begin back at the begining.

5. Once you collect all the dots and reach a max score of 2300 without

falling into a hole, you will be asked to continue to the next level.

6. There are a max of 6 levels, each level will get slightly more difficult.
